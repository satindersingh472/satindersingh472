👋, I am Satinder Singh.
🖥️ I am a junior full stack web developer.
🧩 I did start to learn code online in 2022 and realized that I should be coding to make my living and joined Innotech College, where I learned all the things that are needed for full stack development and made myself job ready.
I have an interest in learning new things and right now I am looking for a job as a junior full stack web developer.
